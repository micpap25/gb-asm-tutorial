- The Gameboy has three palettes: One for the background (BGP) and two for objects (OBP0, OBP1)
    - We will focus on the BGP for now. 
    - The Gameboy Color works differently so it could introduce color.

- The Palettes menu is a tab of BGB's VRAM viewer.
    - The colors are numbered from left to right, numbers 0 to 3.
        - 0 is "white", 1 is "light gray", 2 is "dark gray", and 3 is "black".
        - By default, white isn't very white and black isn't exactly black.
        - Also the original gameboy had green shading to it.
        - The Gameboy Pocket is more black/white, and the Gameboy Color will try to colorize things automatically!

- We can mess with the palette in the "IO map" section of the debugger.
    - By default, the BGP palette is set to $E4. That is to say, 11_10_01_00, so each color matches to the right 2 bits.
    - If we edit the hex, we can get other combinations. Remember to uncheck "show paletted" in the VRAM viewer.
    - This makes fading the screen or inverting colors very cheap and easy!
