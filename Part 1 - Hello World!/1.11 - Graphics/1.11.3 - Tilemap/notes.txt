- Each tile in our Tiles tab has an ID, or Tile Number. It is in hex.
    - There are 256 IDs, but there are 384 (256*3/2) tiles available.
    - Tiles are grouped into 3 128-tile groups, and the Gameboy uses the same set of IDs for the first 128 and last 128.
        - There is a mechanism for determining which will be used, but don't worry about it or the first 128 tiles now.

- We construct our "Hello World" by strategically reusing the tiles we have built.
