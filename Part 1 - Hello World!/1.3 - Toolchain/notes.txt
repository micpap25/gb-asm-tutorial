- RGBASM is an assembler. It reads the source code it is given and produces object files.
    - These object files generally have "holes" because they do not contain all the information for a full ROM.
    - The .o extension indicates an object file.

- RGBLINK is a linker. It takes object files and links them together into a ROM.

- RGBFIX fixes the header of our ROM so it will run properly on a Gameboy.
    - It injects the Nintendo logo for the boot ROM (program which runs on startup).
        - This boot ROM is an anti-piracy measure that confirms the game is valid.
    - It also fixes our ROM to pass both the header checksum and full-ROM checksum.
        - The header checksum is commonly used, the full-ROM one is not, but no reason not to pass both.
