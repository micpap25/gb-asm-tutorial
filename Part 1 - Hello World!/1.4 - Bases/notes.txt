Summary notes:
- Base-10 numbers are expressed without a prefix.
- The following prefixes are used for other bases:
    - Base-2: % (ex. %1010)
    - Base-8: & (ex. &765)
    - Base 16: $ (ex. $FE)
- When individual bits matter, use binary or hex.
    - When you just want a number, use decimal.
- Underscores can be put between digits for spacing (1_000_000)
